Tried provisioning the nodes wiht the script from https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible, but something didn't work out, it just got stuck at "Enable and check K3s service". I wonder if it's related to nodes being connected via Wifi and not Ehterner (somewhere someone said it's a requirement). will try in the next days.
